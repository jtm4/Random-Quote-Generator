# Random-Quote-Generator
 Treehouse Techdegree Project 1

The Random Quote Generator application generates a new random quote each time that a user clicks the `Show another quote` button or refreshes the page. 

The quotes are pulled from an array of quotes containing the actual quote, source (who said the quote), citation (if quote is from a movie, book, etc.) and year the quote was recorded.
