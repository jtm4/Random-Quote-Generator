# Random-Quote-Generator
 Treehouse Techdegree Project 1

The Random Quote Generator application generates a new random quote each time that a user clicks the `Show another quote` button. 

Each random quote is pulled from an array of objects containing the quote, source (i.e. author), citation (movie, book, etc.) and year the quote was recorded.

The web page is set on a timer that generates a new quote at regular intervals, and also randomizes the background color using RGB values.
