# Random Quote Generator

Generate random quotes periodically or on click.

## Features
The Random Quote Generator application generates a new random quote each time that a user clicks the `Show another quote` button. 

Each random quote is pulled from an array of objects containing the quote, source (i.e. author), citation (from a movie, book, etc.), year the quote was recorded, and any tags associated with the quote.

The web page is set on a timer that generates a new quote at regular intervals, and also randomizes the background color using RGB values.
